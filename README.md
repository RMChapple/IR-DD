Catalogue of radiocarbon determinations &amp; dendrochronology dates

## Citation											
											
If you make use of this resource, I expect it to be cited in publications. The full reference should read something like:											
											
Chapple, R. M. 2019 Catalogue of Radiocarbon Determinations & Dendrochronology Dates (August 2019 release) Oculus Obscura Press, Belfast.											
											
If you do not value this research enough to cite it in the publication, please do not use it. Citation in additional content (such as downloadable material) external to the main paper/chapter/book etc. is not sufficient.											
											
## Restrictions											
											
The Catalogue has always been a free-to-use resource for all people working with or just interested in the scientific dating of Irish archaeology											
											
However, recent unprofessional activities by certain parties has led to a ban of the authors of the following paper from using this resource or publishing work based on it in any way:											
Holocene fluctuations in human population demonstrate repeated links to food production and climate											http://www.pnas.org/content/114/49/E10524
											
Published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS)											
											
The banned authors are as follows:
Andrew Bevan University College London http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/bevan

Sue Colledge University College London http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/honorary/colledge

Dorian Fuller University College London http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/fuller

Ralph Fyfe University of Plymouth https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/ralph-fyfe

Stephen Shennan University College London http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/shennan

Chris Stevens University College London http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/cstevens
											
This ban extends to the use of this resource in papers, books, chapters etc. where the above are co-authors or in any way connected											
University College London and Plymouth University do not believe that the conduct of these individuals constitutes plagiarism or is even misconduct of any kind. Thus, to prevent others falling into the same error, the ban on using this resource is extended to all employees of these institutions.											
	(I am prepared, however, to make exceptions on personal application).										
											
As the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) have failed to investigate this matter and retract the offending paper, the ban on using this resource also extends to anyone intending to publish with PNAS.											
											
This notice will remain in place and in force until such time as this matter is resolved.											
											
	Robert M Chapple
